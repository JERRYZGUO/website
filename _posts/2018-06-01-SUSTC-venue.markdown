Researched quantum algorithms and presented to the research group on algorithms such as Shor’s algorithm, Grover’s algorithm, HHL algorithm, and their potential applications. Expanded expressions for the Hamiltonian of transmon entanglements from two transmons to multiple ones and measured the experimental realizability by estimating the magnitude of interactions. Compared quantum machine learning with classical machine learning and gave a final presentation on this topic.
