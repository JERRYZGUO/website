Assembled from scratch the experiment setup for type I spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with $\beta$-Barium Borate. Demonstrated entanglement and remote state preparation of the down-converted photons through statistically analyzing photon coincidence event counts. Reached 0.03 in the ratio of coincidence event counts to single-photon detection counts, which is around 50% higher than past literature. Produced a report and a comprehensive lab manual to convert the experiment to an advanced undergraduate-level teaching lab.
