Desk shadowed in Data, Global Transaction Banking Technology, and Fixed Income & Currencies divisions. Took part in coding challenges on data analysis and risk estimations. Understood the trading process and roles of front, middle, and back offices through simulated trading in group activities. I was offered a position to join in summer 2020 as summer technology intern at the London office after some interviews at the end of the spring week.
