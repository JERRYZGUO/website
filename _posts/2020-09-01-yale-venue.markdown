Simulated the dynamics of one dimensional Hubbard model on multiple coupled oscillator-transmon systems using GRAPE algorithm from optimal control. Improved the performance of GRAPE in QuTip through including customized fidelity expressions, arbitrary initial pulse, etc. The fidelity of dynamics simulation increased from around 90% to 99.9%. Performed variational methods based on the improved GRAPE algorithm on the half-filled Hubbard model under weak hopping. The variational ground state reached an overlap of 99% with the ground state from diagonalization.
