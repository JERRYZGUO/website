Implemented methods to improve the fidelity of state readouts for quantum computing with ion-traps. Benchmarked statistical and machine learning methods on the state readout image for state discrimination such as K-means clustering and maximum likelihood. Replaced Andor camera, the previous state readout camera, with Nuvu camera which has a smaller signal-to-noise ratio. Coordinated with the company of production. Wrote python interfaces to integrate the camera functions written in C++ into the lab server.
