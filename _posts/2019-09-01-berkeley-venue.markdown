Integrated a new readout camera with a low signal-to-noise ratio into the ion-trap setup. Wrote an interface between the camera's C++-based dynamic link library and the Python-based lab code base. Modeled the error sources in the state readout process. Compared readout algorithms based on data from segmented photomultiplier tubes to ones based on images from an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD).
