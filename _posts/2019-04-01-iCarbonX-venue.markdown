Modified Gibbs sampling algorithm for high dimensional combinatorial problems in dietary intake recommendation tasks. Increased performance for 50\% in the testing stage while reaching an acceptable run time. The algorithm is now implemented for industrial usage. Analyzed periodic patterns in data extracted from online posts related to childcare with methods like FFT, correlation coefficient, etc. Applied NLP algorithms such as TF-IDF algorithm and TextRank algorithm for keywords extraction.
