Applied Gibbs sampling method for dietary intake recommendation algorithm. The resulting algorithm increased the performance for 50% and was implemented for industrial usage. Presented the solution on behalf of the group to the technology department. Statistically analyzed the methodology of the algorithm. Extracted periodic patterns from online posts related to childcare using methods like FFT, correlation coefficient, etc. Researched and made use of NLP algorithms such as TF-IDF algorithm and TextRank algorithm for keywords extraction. The paper for Gibbs sampling algorithm is being submitted for publication, and the draft can be provided upon request.
