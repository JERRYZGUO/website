Simulated dynamics of one dimensional Ising model under time-dependent transverse and longitudinal
fields using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) models such as Feed Forward Neural Network and
Restricted Boltzmann Machine. Optimized the fidelity by initializing the parameters with ground states evolved from stochastic
reconfiguration. Implemented Metropolis-Hastings algorithm based on Markov chains for stochastic sampling. Demonstrated the polynomial complexity of the ANN models compared to the exponential scaling of conventional numerical methods for up to 10 spins.
