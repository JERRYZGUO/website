The project aims at solving Ising model and other quantum many-body models using Artifical Neural Networks. It is expected to perform much better than conventional numerical methods for solving Schrodinger equations, i.e. reducing complexity from exponential to polynomial. This project is still ongoing, so some technical details won't be disclosed.
